# UdacityProject4: Build-it-bigger
A demo app showing how multiple modules work together.

Task: 
In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules:

A Java library that provides jokes
A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display
